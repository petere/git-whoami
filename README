git-whoami is an additional Git command that tells you what author and
committer information would (probably) be used for a commit.  This is
particularly helpful if you operate many different Git repositories
with different identities (work, private, different projects).
Inspired by bzr whoami.

To be able to use it, just put it in your path somewhere.  You can
then call it as "git whoami" or directly as "git-whoami".
