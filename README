git-whoami is an additional Git command that tells you what author and
committer information would (probably) be used for a commit.  This is
particularly helpful if you operate many different Git repositories
with different identities (work, private, different projects).
Inspired by bzr whoami.

To use it, either just call it as "git-whoami", or create an alias
like this:

    git config --global alias.whoami git-whoami
